== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* Setup
    Be sure to create a Figaro key device protection following the config/application.example.yml template and use the config/application.yml file to secure this.  You can follow the instructions here for help: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro#give-me-an-example


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
